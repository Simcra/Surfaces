[entity-description]
sky-entrance=Upon entering this access shaft you will be transported to the surface above where you currently stand.\nThese may only be placed in surfaces that are not underground.
sky-exit=Upon entering this access shaft you will be transported to the platform below where you currently stand.\nThese may only be placed on platforms above the planet surface.
underground-entrance=Upon entering this access shaft you will be transported to the surface below where you currently stand.\nThese may only be placed on surfaces which are not above the planet surface.
underground-exit=Upon entering this access shaft you will be transported to the surface above where you currently stand.\nThese may only be placed in underground surfaces.
transport-chest-up=Items in this chest will be transported to a paired Receiver Chest on the surface above, items may be inserted or delivered to this chest by logistics robots.
transport-chest-down=Items in this chest will be transported to a paired Receiver Chest on the surface below, items may be inserted or delivered to this chest by logistics robots.
receiver-chest-lower=Receives items from a paired Transport Chest on the surface above and passively provides them to the logistics network on this surface.
receiver-chest-upper=Receives items from a paired Transport Chest on the surface below and passively provides them to the logistics network on this surface.
electric-pole-lower=Connects to an electric pole on the surface above, use these to connect your electricity network between surfaces.
electric-pole-upper=Connects to an electric pole on the surface below, use these to connect your electricity network between surfaces.
fluid-transport-lower=Connects to a storage tank on the surface above, use these to move your fluids between surfaces.
fluid-transport-upper=Connects to a storage tank on the surface below, use these to move your fluids between surfaces.
